# hidden-sphere-rpg

Hidden Sphere, or Esfera Escondida in Brazilian Portuguese, is the name given to my own Medieval Fantasy RPG setting.

Inspired by Forgotten Realms, Lost Omans, Tolkien, Warcraft, and many others, Hidden Sphere brings a detailed world to support RPG campaigns, preferably using the Pathfinder 2 or D&D 5e systems.

Hidden Sphere is a Wiki created by me to assist in organizing the items and points of my setting and also to help me learn to code better.

A prototype of this project is always online at [Hidden Sphere Website](https://www.drakbits.com)
